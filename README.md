Predicting Flight Delays Using Machine Learning

Project Overview :

This project focuses on analyzing the on-time performance of domestic flights in the United States, using data provided by the U.S. Department of Transportation's Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS). The dataset comprises 1,247,488 rows and 30 columns, offering a comprehensive overview of flight schedules, delays, cancellations, diversions, and their causes.
The primary goal is to identify key factors affecting air travel punctuality and develop predictive models to anticipate flight delays. This analysis aims to provide actionable insights for airlines, passengers, and policymakers.

Dataset :

The dataset includes detailed attributes such as:Flight Information: Year, Month, DayofMonth, DayOfWeek, UniqueCarrier, FlightNum, TailNum
Schedule and Timing: DepTime, CRSDepTime, ArrTime, CRSArrTime, ActualElapsedTime, CRSElapsedTime, AirTime
Delays and Causes: ArrDelay, DepDelay, CarrierDelay, WeatherDelay, NASDelay, SecurityDelay, LateAircraftDelay
Flight Status: Cancelled, CancellationCode, Diverted
Other Metrics: Origin, Dest, Distance, TaxiIn, TaxiOut

Key Insights: Random Forest Regressor (with and without tuning) achieved the best performance, indicating its robustness in handling complex relationships in the data.
Delay-related features, such as DepDelay and ArrDelay, were significant predictors of overall flight performance.
External factors like WeatherDelay also played a critical role in determining flight punctuality.


Conclusion : This project successfully demonstrates the use of machine learning to predict flight delays and highlights the critical factors influencing air travel punctuality. The insights gained can help airlines optimize operations and improve customer experience.
